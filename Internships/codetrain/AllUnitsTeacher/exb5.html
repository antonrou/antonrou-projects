          <h2>Physical Layer
</h2>
<p>At Layer 1,<span style = "color:red;" > the Physical layer</span> of the OSI model is responsible for ultimate transmission of digital data bits from the Physical layer of the sending (source) device over network communications media to the Physical layer of the receiving (destination) device. Examples of Layer 1 technologies include Ethernet cables and Token Ring networks. Additionally, hubs and other repeaters are standard network devices that function at the Physical layer, as are cable connectors.
At the Physical layer, data are transmitted using the type of signaling supported by the physical medium: electric voltages, radio frequencies, or pulses of infrared or ordinary light.</p>

    <h2>Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model
</h2>
<p>The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model defines a networking framework to implement protocols in layers, with control passed from one layer to the next. It is primarily used today as a teaching tool. It conceptually divides computer network architecture into 7 layers in a logical progression. The lower layers deal with electrical signals, chunks of binary data, and routing of these data across networks. Higher levels cover network requests and responses, representation of data, and network protocols as seen from a user's point of view. 
The OSI model was originally conceived as a standard architecture for building network systems and indeed, many popular network technologies today reflect the layered design of OSI.</p>
