            <li>Client Server relationship presents the internetworked nature of the <a href = "WebPageLanguages.html" target="_blank">internet</a></li>
            <li>The server component provides a function or service to one or many clients, which initiate requests for such services. For example, a web server serves web pages and a file server serves computer files</li>
            <li>When a bank customer accesses online banking services with a web browser (the client), the client initiates a request to the bank's web server. The customer's login credentials may be stored in a database, and the web server accesses the database server as a client. An application server interprets the returned data by applying the bank's business logic, and provides the output to the web server. Finally, the web server returns the result to the client web browser for display.</li>

            <li>Servers, work stations, sub networks, mid-level networks, regional networks are the backbone that makes up the Internet.</li>

            <li><h3>Switches</h3></li>
            <p>A network switch is a computer networking device that connects devices on a computer network by using packet switching to receive, process, and forward data to the destination device</p>
