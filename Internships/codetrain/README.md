In June 2022, the summer before Grade 12, Dr. Cameron Macdonell, a Computer Science professor at MacEwan University, and Mr. Scott Couprie, a teacher at Edmonton Public Schools, contracted me to develop software for CODETRAIN, an organization they founded providing computer science resources to high school teachers across Alberta. I created repositories holding teaching examples for teachers to access for both the "CSA" and the "Package 3" programs that CODETRAIN provides. These lesson plans can be found at the following links:

CSA:

Package 3 Parts 1 and 2:

For the CSA repository, I created the "Main.java" file and the "Library.java" file. I also went through each example, fixing any broken code, making sure each example ran as intended. I created an html file for each teaching example, as well as the "index.html" and the "indexstyle.css" files. The files can be found here:

For the Package 3 repository, I created an HTML file that provides an explanation and demonstration of each coding example, as well as the "index.html" and the "indexstyle.css" files. Again, I made sure each example worked and fixed its code if it didn't so that it ran as intended. The files can be found here:
