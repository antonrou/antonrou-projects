In June 2022 under the supervision of Macewan University professor Dr. Macdonell and Edmonton Public Schools teacher Mr. Couprie, I created the parent class to access all the teaching examples for Computer Science 20 and Computer Science 30 Alberta Curriculum for the professional develoopment company CODETRAIN. I also created the HTML webpage.
Created with JavaScript, Java, and HTML.
