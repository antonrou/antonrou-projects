In June 2022, the summer before Grade 12, I worked under the guidance of Dr. Macdonell, a professor at MacEwan University, and Mr. Couprie, a teacher with Edmonton Public Schools. I developed a parent class to manage all teaching examples for the Alberta Computer Science 20 and 30 curriculum for the professional development company CODETRAIN. Additionally, I designed the HTML webpage using JavaScript, Java, and HTML.
