In June 2022, the summer before Grade 12, Dr. Cameron Macdonell, a Computer Science professor at MacEwan University, and Mr. Scott Couprie, a teacher at Edmonton Public Schools, contracted me to develop software for CODETRAIN, an organization they founded providing computer science resources to high school teachers across Alberta. I created a main repository for teachers to fork from which holds teaching examples for Grade 11 and 12 computer science courses. The CSA Lesson Plan can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/132O1epc7qCv83M2Va4gc3v_du_P4TvCMgqa4KiSIIuc/edit?tab=t.0. 

I went through each coding example from the workbook and ensured it worked, fixing it if it didn't. I also created a file with an explanation and demonstration of each coding example. Code can be found in my GitHub repository. For the teaching examples repository, I created an html file for each teaching example, as well as the "index.html" and the "indexstyle.css" files. These can be found here: https://replit.com/@antonroupassov1/AllUnitsTeacher#exf4.html
